## About

All you have to do is aim your phone at it, scan it and identify artworks, access rich interpretation..

it is an AI-based app which helps users to explore the surroundings and get enlightened. It seamlessly ties together context, history and the artist's voice to provide a rich and interactive experience in less than 100 words. We work in the field of value creation with the themes such as art, culture, rituals, heritage, history, tribal values, exhibitions, events and many more.
We aim to become a media between what you get and what artist ( or surrounding values) wants to convey and acknowledge the reality the way it is in a very short and entertaining way.

We use Digital Technologies such as Swarm Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Data Analysis, IOE etc. to not only as accessible educational resources in a fun way but also as an innovative approach to visitor engagement in the digital era.

We believe that Art is the only universal language, and there are centuries of stories to tell.

## Technology Stack
The Major Technologies used by this application are:
    -Android
    -Php
    -Tensorflow (Python)
    -Big query
    -IBM Cloud
    -Swarm Intelligence
    -IOE
    -Data APIs
    -Google APIs

These are the major technologies. However, there are some more technologies used at the backend to provide additional functionalities.
AI is the backend of the app but human intelligence is the backbone. The concept of the app is highly based on the theory called WYSIATI (What you see is all there is) in psychology given by Nobel prize winner Dr. Danial Kahneman. 
As he says and we quote 
  "We can be blind to the obvious. And we can also be blind to our blindness."
Where we promise and say 
  "Don't stop before the threshold. First, get enlightened and then go beyond the limits of your imagination."

## Working of Functionalities
  
  ### Cognitive Search
      - Unlock the stories behind the surrounding.
      - No more struggling to read those tiny labels or lengthy noisy blogs, it instantly identifies and suggests the value and serves quality-checked information.
      - It's an introduction to the new era of search by just scanning the item without any barcode.

      
  ### Swarm Intelligence
      - It opens the door for strong AI in reality and strengthens the decision science. The science enables the ants to find the shortest path and follow and honey Bees to work in a group to decide new home without any need for leadership.
      - The science helps us to study users behavior, understanding, and interaction in a group and let them serve what each of them as an individual cherishes.
      
  ### Interactive Walkthroughs
      - To suggest the user the valuable stories in the surrounding. 
      - Check suggested highlights by the museum or go your own way! The app lets you dip in and out of tours and independent scanning.
      - Explore everything in the event/exhibition/museum with maintaining privacy and security of the artworks. 

  ### Promote and support art and events
      - Discover more
      - Browse trending exhibitions and artworks. Explore artists, curators, and venues.
      - Promote your meaningful event and reach to every doorstep.
      
  ### Others
      - Multilinguistic support (especially for rural and tribal advantages)
      - Sharing of knowledge on various platforms (social media) with a click.



## Rajasthan Hackathon
  This project has been built for Rajasthan hackathon 4.0. The idea of the app we define is a perfect fit for these 5 parameters as:
  - Sustainable
  - Motivational
  - Affordable
  - Responsible
  - Transformational
We aim to scale and diversify in the field with authentication and support by the government and the tourism department. We plan to have a startup and winning the contest definitely makes it possible in the most beautiful way.
